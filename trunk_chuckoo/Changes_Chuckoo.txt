Cleanup of Cutlist Work Frame
CLEAR CUTLIST button now really clears the cutlist, not only the table content.
( not sure if we should once add a warning ...do you really ... )

Added an Option in settings NO Notify on Cutlist...  to save mouseclicks (avoid popups ) when saving/loading of cutlist succeeds.
